# facebook-marketing skill
This will be a Skills project for Mycroft AI in order to utilize the Facebook Marketing API.

More detailed explanation to come as the API is learned and implemented into this skill.

To get this done, we need:
- `facebookads` - a Python package that provides interface between your Python application and Facebook's [Marketing API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-apis)
    - compatible with Python 2 and 3
- Also need [these pre-requisites](https://github.com/facebook/facebook-python-ads-sdk#pre-requisites) from Facebook's SDK
    - be sure to review the special requirements for Python3
